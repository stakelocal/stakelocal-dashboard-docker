## Instructions
## ============
##   This file will work as-is for a RocketPool system using locally-managed
##   ethereum clients. 
##
##   For consensus, execution, and validator clients, valid values for software
##   are "besu", "erigon", "geth", "lighthouse", "lodestar", "nimbus",
##   "nethermind", "prysm", or "teku". Using any other value or adding
##   additional descriptive information to the client_name value will break
##   some portions of the dashboard. See online documentation for information
##   on using the "service" field as a more descriptive name.
##
##   Update host values to the name of the server/host/VM on which this 
##   docker application is running.
##
##   The validators field should be a comma-delimited list of validator indices
##   or addresses. Both are are allowed at the same time in the list, but each
##   validator should only be listed once.
##
##   The fee_addresses field must be a comma-delimited list of quoted Ethereum
##   addresses. Omitting the quotes will break some dashboard panels.
##
##   All metrics_address and api_address values should remain as they are.
