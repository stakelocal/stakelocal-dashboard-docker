#
# minimal_goerli_config_v1.0.yml
#
# This is smallest configuration file possible for a Goerli staking group.
#
# Notes:
#  - The Stake Local Dashboard supports multiple consensus/execution client
#    pairs (groups), but this configuration assumes a single group. See the 
#    multi_group_config_v1.0.yml file for a complete configuration supporting
#    multiple consensus/execution client pairs on various networks.
#  - This configuration assumes Goerli. See the minimal_mainnet_config_v1.0.yml
#    file for the smallest functional Mainnet configuration.
#  - Default values are used for the staking group name (Default Group)
#    and the host name (Default Host). See the recommended_config_v1.0.yml
#    for the smallest configuration that allows configuration that allows
#    customization of group and host names.
#
# Instructions:
#  - The section with service_type equal to "validator" may be removed if you
#    are not using a stand-alone validator client.
#  - service_type values that remain must not be modified.
#  - software values must be one of besu, erigon, geth, lighthouse, lodestar,
#    nethermind, nimbus, prysm, or teku.
#  - metrics_address and api_address values must include a LAN IP address and
#    port only. Do not use a loopback IP address such as localhost or 
#    127.0.0.1.
#  - metrics_address and api_address value ports must be opened and accessible
#    to the Stake Local Dashboard docker continers.
#  - validators values may be validator indices or addresses.
#  - fee_addresses values must be quoted (single or double quotes).
#  - consensus_explorer and execution_explorer must be the domain names of
#    the beaconcha.in and etherscan.io instances for the Ethereum network used.
#  - group_name and network values are for informational/labeling purposes only
#    and do not require specific values.
#
# Additional Note on node_exporter:
#  - When running in a docker container, node_exporter will not have access
#    to all of the metrics available to a stand-alone node_exporter instance.
#    If you would like to see all node_exporter metrics, node_exporter must
#    be run and configured as a stand-alone service. See the
#    multi_group_config_v1.0.yml file for more information on configuring
#    a stand-along node_exporter instance.
